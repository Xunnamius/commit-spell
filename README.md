# commit-spell

`commit-spell` unites Atom's [multi-platform spellchecker][2] (bindings for
Hunspell, Windows Spell Check API, and NSSpellChecker), VSCode's [Code Spell
Checker][3] dictionaries, custom local and user dictionaries, and words from
your repository's commit history to spellcheck your commit messages as you craft
them.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev commit-spell
```

This is a [dual CJS2/ES module][dual-module] package. That means this package
exposes both CJS2 and ESM entry points.

Loading this package via `require(...)` will cause Node and Webpack to use the
[CJS2 bundle][cjs2] entry point, disable [tree shaking][tree-shaking] in Webpack
4, and lead to larger bundles in Webpack 5. Alternatively, loading this package
via `import { ... } from ...` or `import(...)` will cause Node to use the ESM
entry point in [versions that support it][node-esm-support], as will Webpack.
Using the `import` syntax is the modern, preferred choice.

For backwards compatibility with Webpack 4 (_compat with Webpack 4 is not
guaranteed!_) and Node versions < 14, [`package.json`][package-json] retains the
[`module`][module-key] key, which points to the ESM entry point, and the
[`main`][exports-main-key] key, which points to the CJS2 entry point explicitly
(using the .js file extension). For Webpack 5 and Node versions >= 14,
[`package.json`][package-json] includes the [`exports`][exports-main-key] key,
which points to both entry points explicitly.

Though [`package.json`][package-json] includes
[`{ "type": "commonjs"}`][local-pkg], note that the ESM entry points are ES
module (`.mjs`) files. [`package.json`][package-json] also includes the
[`sideEffects`][side-effects-key] key, which is `false` for [optimal tree
shaking][tree-shaking], and the `types` key, which points to a TypeScript
declarations file.

Additionally, this package does not maintain shared state and so does not
exhibit the [dual package hazard][hazard].

</details>

## Usage

> [`git`][4] is required to run `commit-spell`.

`commit-spell` can be run by hand‚Äîwhere the current working directory is the
root of your repository‚Äîor as part of a [commit-msg git hook][5]:

```bash
npx commit-spell
```

When run, it looks for a `<current working directory>/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` file
and checks its (utf-8) contents for spelling errors. In addition to the
platform-specific spellchecker and words in the [text-extensions][6] dictionary,
a word can be whitelisted by adding it to one of the following:

- `<current working directory>/.spellcheckignore` or
  `<user home directory>/.config/_spellcheckignore` on a new line
- `<current working directory>/package.json` as a key under _dependencies_,
  _devDependencies_, _peerDependencies_, or _scripts_
- `<current working directory>/.vscode/settings.json` or
  `<user home directory>/.config/Code/User/settings.json` as an element of
  _cSpell.words_, _cSpell.userWords_, or _cSpell.ignoreWords_
- Any word appearing in the output of `git log --format="%B" HEAD~1`

Additionally, you can use `--help` to get help text output, `--version` to get
the current version, `--silent` to prevent all output, and `--show-all` to show
all potential typos.

### Example

This repository [uses itself to spellcheck its own commits][7] via [husky][8].

### Importing as a Module

This package can be imported and run directly in source without spawning a child
process or calling a CLI. This is useful for, for instance, composing multiple
[yargs][1]-based CLI tools together.

```typescript
import { configureProgram } from 'commit-spell';

const { program, parse } = configureProgram();
// `program` is a yargs instance
// `parse` is an async function that will (eventually) call program.parse(...)
await parse([]);
```
